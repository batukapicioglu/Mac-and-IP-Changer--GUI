Mac and IP address changer.Graphic interface and easy to use
INTRODUCTION
MAC Address, abbreviated as Media Access Control address, is the distinct serial number given for each interface from the factory by its vendor. In simpler words, it is the exclusive, worldwide physical identification number given to every device that is connected to a network interface, be it wired or wireless. This address is used to recognize the communications of the network interface on every local network. MAC address includes 48 bits, or 6 bytes, and takes the subsequent format: ‘XX:XX:XX:YY:YY: YY’. Let us learn more about mac spoofing attack.

An IP address is used to recognize where you are on the Internet and the MAC address is used to recognize what device is on the local network. This MAC address is virtually burned to the hardware by the vendor and hence the end-user cannot alter or rewrite this burned–in address (BIA). However, masking the MAC address on the software side is possible and this is how MAC spoofing works.

With this program, it allows you to change your IP( Internet Protocol ) address and Mac Address (Media Access Control) with the graphical interface.

Note: This is the demo version which is still under development and improvement.
